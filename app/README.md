# Completed task
So, I took over 2 days working on the project, most of the heavy lifting was done within the first day. Looking for a library to create unique colours took me down a 
rabbit hole that I spent a few days chasing unitl eventually I setteled with one of the many available libraries.

## What did I learn?
- I was able to demonstrate my problem skills with the problem statement
- I was able to showcase my resourcefullness by selecting a library for colour coding the letters and also contributing to a few of the other libraries

## Things I would try improving
- The colour scheme is pretty basic and barely works together
- The overall architechture of making popups to display the results can be imporoved to make things less jittery 
- I would work a bit more on the distinguishability of the colours used to encode the letters

## Libraries used
- [uniqolor](https://www.npmjs.com/package/uniqolor)
